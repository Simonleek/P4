P4: Final
- The final project should bring together all the skills we've learned throughout the semester to create a fully functioning web application that uses PHP, Laravel and a database.

Task
- This project is open-ended. Whatever you create, the main expectation is that the project meets the following criteria:
		- Uses PHP/Laravel.
		- Uses a database with at least 2 tables. This count does not include a users table, but does include pivot tables.
		- Demonstrates all 4 CRUD interactions (user signup/login does not count towards this).
		- If you started this course at a more advanced level and your confidence in the material is high, you are encouraged to create an app of your choosing. The sky is the limit.
		- If you want a bit more guidance, you're welcome to use the Task Manager spec below as your project subject.

Sample Project Idea: Task Manager
	Should include:
		User authentication so different users can have their own task lists.
		A page to display all incomplete tasks.
		A page to display all completed tasks.
		A page to display all tasks with incomplete tasks in bold and completed tasks greyed out.
		A page to add new tasks.
		A page to edit the content of existing tasks.
		Whenever a task is displayed, it should list the date it was created and if complete, when it was completed.

Use error checking: Don't allow empty tasks, don't allow duplicate email sign-ups, etc.

Extra Challenges
	Add the ability to edit the date of existing tasks.
	Add the option to email a task.
	Add/edit tasks via Ajax.
	Add the ability to login via OAuth.

Misc
	When completed, do not forget to add the link to your project and its Github repository to your P1 Portfolio.

FAQ: Does my site have to include user authentication?
	 Only if it makes sense for what you're creating.

	 For example, if you create a site that lets users create track of gift ideas, it makes sense that your site would support individual users with their own lists.

	 If however, you're creating a site that lets anonymous visitors vote on their favorite recipe each month, accommodating individual users is not necessarily required.
